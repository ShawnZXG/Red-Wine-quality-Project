# Red-Wine-quality-Project
The red wine data set contains 12 columns and 1599 rows of data related to the Portuguese Vinho Verde red wine, which is exported from the Northwest region of Portugal.
Each row of data corresponds to one variant of the red wine sample from this region. There are 11 input variables, all of which are physicochemical data expressed in numerical values.
These input variables were measured by physicochemical tests in the laboratory environment. The measured results of variables such as citric acid, chlorides, and sulfates show the concentrations of such chemicals in the wine.

#Study:
How do physicochemical properties affect the ranking of red wine quality?
